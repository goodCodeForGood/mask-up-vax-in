# Mask Up, Vax In
As part of Google's Computer Science Summer Institute Program (CSSI), I worked with Shirley Li and Guzel Abdubek to build this final project.

We built this project in 2021 when the COVID pandemic was not yet fully recovered. So, we decided to design "Mask Up, Vax In" as an interactive and fun-filled JavaScript game that  spreads social awareness and encourages everyone to get their COVID-19 vaccination. 


## Skills
We used the following languages and skills to create this project:

JavaScript, p5.js, HTML, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), Game Design, and Game Development
