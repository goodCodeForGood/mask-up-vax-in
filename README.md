# Mask Up, Vax In
As part of Google's Computer Science Summer Institute Program (CSSI), I worked with Shirley Li and Guzel Abdubek to build this final project.

We built this project in 2021 when the COVID pandemic was not yet fully recovered. So, we decided to design "Mask Up, Vax In" as an interactive and fun-filled JavaScript game that  spreads social awareness and encourages everyone to get their COVID-19 vaccination. 

Mask Up, Vax In" is inspired by the Frogger game. To win the game, the user must maintain social distancing until they approach their vaccine appointment time. If the user does get into contact with any of the virus structures, then the user enters into a Pokemon-inspired battle between the user's immune system cells and the COVID-19 virus. This is the last chance for the user to get enough points to recover from the virus and continue the game. 

## Skills
We used the following languages and skills to create this project:

JavaScript, p5.js, HTML, Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), Game Design, and Game Development

This was my first time using p5.js for a final project.
